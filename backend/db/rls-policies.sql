-- =====================================================
-- NOTES
-- =====================================================
-- 1. All policies use auth.uid() to identify the current user
-- 2. Admins (owner/baker) have elevated permissions
-- 3. Public read access is limited to non-sensitive data
-- 4. All write operations require authentication
-- 5. Users can only modify their own data (except admins)
