-- Notes:
-- =====================================================
-- 1. Views are automatically updated when underlying data changes
-- 2. Use these views for dashboard queries to improve performance
-- 3. RLS policies apply to views based on underlying table policies
-- 4. Views can be materialized if needed for better performance
