<objective>
Verify order confirmation and ready notification emails work end-to-end across all language and delivery option combinations.

Purpose: Confirm existing email infrastructure works correctly before considering Phase 2 complete. This is verification work, not feature development.

Output: Verified email functionality with documented test results and troubleshooting guide.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Pre-flight checks and infrastructure verification</name>
  <files>N/A (verification commands only)</files>
  <action>
Verify email infrastructure is ready before manual testing:

1. Check Supabase Edge Functions are deployed:
   - Run: `supabase functions list` (or check via Supabase Dashboard)
   - Verify `send-order-confirmation` and `send-ready-notification` are listed

2. Check required secrets are set:
   - Run: `supabase secrets list`
   - Verify `RESEND_API_KEY`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and `OWNER_EMAIL` are configured

3. Check backend environment variables:
   - Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in backend .env

4. Review Edge Function code for correct FRONTEND_URL usage:
   - Confirm tracking links will point to correct domain (elisbakery.com or dev URL)

Report any missing configuration before proceeding to testing.
  </action>
  <verify>
All commands complete without errors. All required secrets and env vars are confirmed present.

  <done>
Infrastructure verified ready for email testing. Any missing configuration documented.

  <name>Task 2: Manual email testing - Test Matrix</name>
  <action-required>
Place 4 test orders covering the complete test matrix. This requires payment processing which cannot be automated.

**Test Matrix:**

| Test # | Language | Delivery Option | Test Steps |
|--------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | English | Pickup | Set site to EN, place order with pickup |
| 2 | English | Delivery | Set site to EN, place order with delivery |
| 3 | Spanish | Pickup | Set site to ES, place order with pickup |
| 4 | Spanish | Delivery | Set site to ES, place order with delivery |

**For each test order:**

1. **Before placing order:**
   - Note start time: __:__
   - Set language toggle (EN or ES) on site
   - Use incognito browser to avoid cached language

2. **Place test order via /order page:**
   - Customer name: "Test Customer [Test#]"
   - Email: Your personal email address
   - Phone: +1 (610) 555-1234
   - Test data for cake (any size/filling/theme)
   - For delivery tests: use "123 Test St, Norristown, PA 19401"
   - Complete payment (use test card if in sandbox mode)
   - Note order number: ORD-____

3. **Verify Order Confirmation Email:**
   - Check inbox (wait up to 60 seconds)
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox
   - Verify: Language matches, order details correct, tracking link works
   - Note time received: __:__
   - Calculate delay: ___ seconds
   - Record: PASS/FAIL + any issues

4. **Change order status to "ready":**
   - Navigate to /front-desk or /owner-dashboard
   - Find order by order number
   - Change status to "ready"
   - Note time of status change: __:__

5. **Verify Ready Notification Email:**
   - Check inbox (wait up to 60 seconds)
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox
   - Verify: Language matches, pickup/delivery info correct, tracking link works
   - For pickup: Shows bakery address
   - For delivery: Shows customer's delivery address
   - Note time received: __:__
   - Calculate delay: ___ seconds
   - Record: PASS/FAIL + any issues

6. **Cancel test order to clean up:**
   - Change status to cancelled in dashboard

**Record all results in a simple table format to share with Claude.**
  </action-required>
  <resume-signal>
Share test results as a table showing: Test#, Order#, Confirmation Email (PASS/FAIL + delay), Ready Email (PASS/FAIL + delay), Issues found
  </resume-signal>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Debug any failures and create troubleshooting guide</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/02-verify-order-emails/02-TROUBLESHOOTING.md</files>
  <action>
Based on test results from Task 2:

**If all tests passed:**
Create the troubleshooting guide documenting:
1. How to verify Edge Functions are deployed (`supabase functions list`)
2. How to check function logs for errors (Dashboard navigation)
3. How to verify secrets are set (`supabase secrets list`)
4. Common issues and solutions from RESEARCH.md:
   - Email landing in spam (check SPF/DKIM in Resend dashboard)
   - Edge function invocation failures (missing secrets, not deployed)
   - Wrong language in email (check customer_language field)
   - Missing order details (check order data passed to function)
   - Delivery delay beyond 1 minute (check function execution time)

**If any tests failed:**
1. Check Supabase Edge Function logs for errors
2. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
3. Verify order record has correct customer_language value
4. Debug and fix issues
5. Re-test affected scenarios
6. Document the issue and fix in troubleshooting guide

Write troubleshooting guide to: `.planning/phases/02-verify-order-emails/02-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

  <verify>
`cat .planning/phases/02-verify-order-emails/02-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` shows complete guide with at least 5 common issues documented.
