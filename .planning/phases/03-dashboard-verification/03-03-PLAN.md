<objective>
Verify that both Owner Dashboard and Front Desk Dashboard function correctly after cleanup and integration.

Purpose: Ensure all dashboard requirements (DASH-01 through DASH-05) are met through manual verification of analytics, order handling, real-time updates, and cleanup completeness.
Output: Verified dashboards ready for production use.

  <name>Verify Owner Dashboard Functionality</name>
  <what-built>
    After cleanup and tab integration:
    - Dead code removed (BakerStation, unused layouts, dev components, test data utilities)
    - Products tab integrated with MenuManager
    - Inventory tab integrated with InventoryManager
    - All original dashboard functionality preserved
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
    2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/owner-dashboard (or login as owner)

    **DASH-01: Analytics Display**
    3. Verify metric cards display:
       - "Revenue Today" shows dollar amount
       - "Orders Today" shows count with pending sub-count
       - "Avg Ticket" shows per-order average
    4. Verify charts render:
       - Line chart shows revenue trends (7D/30D toggle works)
       - Pie chart shows order status breakdown

    **DASH-05: Owner-Specific Features**
    5. Click through all sidebar tabs:
       - Overview: Shows metrics, charts, recent orders
       - Orders: Shows full order list with search
       - Calendar: Shows calendar view with orders
       - Products: Shows MenuManager (product table)
       - Inventory: Shows InventoryManager (ingredient cards)
       - Reports: Shows report export buttons

    **DASH-04: Cleanup Verification**
    6. Open browser DevTools (F12) Console tab
    7. Check NO console errors appear
    8. Check "Generate Test Data" button is NOT present in header

    **Expected Results:**
    - All 6 sidebar tabs work and render content
    - Metrics show actual numbers (may be 0 if no orders)
    - Charts render (may be empty if no data)
    - No console errors
    - No test data button visible
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Type "owner-dashboard-verified" if all checks pass.
    If issues found, describe them and type "issues-found: [description]"
  </resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Verify Front Desk Dashboard and Real-time Updates</name>
  <what-built>
    Front Desk dashboard unchanged by cleanup (uses its own components).
    Real-time subscription via useRealtimeOrders hook.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **DASH-02: Order Queue Functionality**
    1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/front-desk
    2. Verify order cards display with:
       - Customer name and order number
       - Order status badge
       - Delivery/pickup indicator
    3. Test status filter tabs (if present): New, Preparing, Pickup, Delivery, Done
    4. Click on an order card - should open details or trigger action

    **DASH-03: Real-time Updates**
    5. Open BOTH dashboards in separate browser tabs:
       - Tab 1: http://localhost:5173/owner-dashboard
       - Tab 2: http://localhost:5173/front-desk
    6. If you have existing orders, try changing status on Front Desk
    7. Verify Owner Dashboard updates within 5 seconds (toast notification, order list refresh)

    **Console Check**
    8. Check both tabs for console errors - should be none

    **Expected Results:**
    - Front Desk shows order cards (or empty state if no orders)
    - Filter tabs work to show orders by status
    - Real-time updates propagate between dashboards
    - No console errors on either dashboard
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Type "front-desk-verified" if all checks pass.
    If issues found, describe them and type "issues-found: [description]"

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Final Build Verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run final verification commands:

    1. Run production build: `npm run build`
       - Should complete without errors or warnings

    2. Run type check: `npx tsc --noEmit`
       - Should show no type errors

    3. Verify deleted files are gone:
       ```bash
       ls src/pages/BakerStation.tsx 2>/dev/null && echo "ERROR: BakerStation still exists" || echo "OK: BakerStation deleted"
       ls src/components/dev/ 2>/dev/null && echo "ERROR: dev folder still exists" || echo "OK: dev folder deleted"
       ls src/test-orders.ts 2>/dev/null && echo "ERROR: test-orders still exists" || echo "OK: test-orders deleted"
       ```

    4. Verify no orphaned imports:
       ```bash
       grep -r "BakerStation\|DevTools\|generateTestData\|test-orders" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "// " || echo "OK: No orphaned imports"
       ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    `npm run build` exits with code 0
    `npx tsc --noEmit` exits with code 0
    All deleted files confirmed gone
    No orphaned imports found
  </verify>
  <done>
    Production build succeeds. TypeScript reports no errors. All dead code removed. No orphaned imports.
  </done>
</task>

Phase 3 requirements verification:

| Requirement | Status | How Verified |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| DASH-01: Owner analytics display | Via checkpoint | Metric cards + charts |
| DASH-02: Front Desk order queue | Via checkpoint | Order cards + filters |
| DASH-03: Real-time updates | Via checkpoint | Cross-tab order updates |
| DASH-04: Remove unused components | Via build + grep | No deleted files referenced |
| DASH-05: Owner analytics-focused | Via checkpoint | 6 tabs including Products/Inventory |
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Owner Dashboard checkpoint passes - all 6 tabs work, metrics display, charts render
2. Front Desk checkpoint passes - order queue works, filters function
3. Real-time updates verified - changes propagate between dashboards
4. Production build succeeds with no errors
5. No console errors on either dashboard
6. All dead code confirmed removed
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-dashboard-verification/03-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
